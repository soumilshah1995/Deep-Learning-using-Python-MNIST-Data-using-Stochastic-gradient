Machine Learning and Deep Learning using Python

The Dense Neural Network was Created using Python after Different analysis results obtained were Great 
we Observed that as as Learning Rate increases Accuracy Increases, and loss decreases, and time increases and 
As Neuron increases loss increases and Accuracy decreases and time increases even when learning rate increases
